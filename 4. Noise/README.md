* [Implementing Noise Model](../4.%20Noise/addnoise.m) addnoise.m  
    Simulate noise in your image by adding them because who even likes clear images.
* [Noise Reduction](../4.%20Noise/reducenoise.m) reducenoise.m  
    Adding noise and removing them from the original image.
* [Simulating a Motion Blur Effect](../4.%20Noise/motionblur.m) motionblur.m  
    Simulate a motion blur then use Wiener filter to deblur the image.
