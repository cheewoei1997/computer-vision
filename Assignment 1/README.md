# Assignment 1
### Challenge 1
You work as an image processing specialist at the Malayan National Hospital. You are given an ultrasound of a baby scan shown in Figure 1 (ultrasound.jpg). Your task is to enhance this image by sharpening it to bring out more of the baby bodyâ€™s detail. The narrow dynamic range of the intensity levels and high noise content make this image difficult to enhance. Try to come out with a strategy to increase the dynamic range of the intensity levels. You can combine various types of image processing techniques like sharpening/smoothing filter, contrast stretching, and noise removal to achieve your objective. A sample output image is shown in Figure 2.
