### Thresholding
Turning them all black and white cuz who likes colours anyway.

1. [Simple Thresholding](../7.%20Thresholding/simplethresh.m) simplethresh.m  
    Automatic thresholding that's done by the computer.
2. [Adaptive Thresholding](../7.%20Thresholding/adaptivethresh.m) adaptivethresh.m  
    Separate the image into blocks and find the threshold for that specific block.
3. **[Incomplete]** [Incorporating Filter Technique in Thresholding](../7.%20Thresholding/filterthresh.m) filterthresh.m  
    Utilise filters on top of thresholding to achieve better results.
