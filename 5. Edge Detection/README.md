### Edge Detection
Edge detection algorithms are what's lit here.

1. [Implementing Edge Detector](../5.%20Edge%20Detection/edgedetectors.m) edgedetectors.m  
    Edge detecting with Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts, and Canny.
2. [Sobel Edge Detector](../5.%20Edge%20Detection/sobeledgedetector.m) sobeledgedetector.m  
    Detecting vertical, horizontal, +45 degree and -45 degree edges with Sobel.
3. [The Laplacian Operator](../5.%20Edge%20Detection/laplacian.m) laplacian.m  
    Using the laplacian operator to sharpen the image by subtracting.
