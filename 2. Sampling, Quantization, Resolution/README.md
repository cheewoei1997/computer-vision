### 2. Sampling, Quantization, Resolution
Playing with images using pixels, colours, and filters.

i. [Sampling](../2.%20Sampling,%20Quantization,%20Resolution/sampling.m) sampling.m
    The play of pixels on an image to resize them. This effect will usually cause the checkboard effect.
ii. [Quantization](../2.%20Sampling,%20Quantization,%20Resolution/quantization.m) quantization.m
    Manipulation on the number of gray levels on an image to simplify the image.
iii. [Resolution](../2.%20Sampling,%20Quantization,%20Resolution/resolution.m) resolution.m
    The use of filters with values of ones to demonstrate gaussian blurring.
