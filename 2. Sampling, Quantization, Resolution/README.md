### 1. Basics
The very basics of Matlab to get you started real quick.

1. [Sampling](../2.%20Sampling,%20Quantization,%20Resolution/sampling.m) sampling.m
    The play of pixels on an image to resize them. This effect will usually cause the checkboard effect.
2. [Quantization](../2.%20Sampling,%20Quantization,%20Resolution/quantization.m) quantization.m
    Manipulation on the number of gray levels on an image to simplify the image.
3. [Resolution](../2.%20Sampling,%20Quantization,%20Resolution/resolution.m) resolution.m
    The use of filters with values of ones to demonstrate gaussian blurring.
