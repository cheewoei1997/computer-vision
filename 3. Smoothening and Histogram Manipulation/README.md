### 3. Smoothening and Histogram Manipulation
We play with contrast stretching and median filter in this lab.

* [Contrast Stretching and Histogram Equalization](../3.%20Smoothening%20and%20Histogram%20Equalization/contraststretchhistoequal.m) contraststretchhistoequal.m  
    Contrast stretching vs. histogram equalization.
* [Quantization](../3.%20Smoothening%20and%20Histogram%20Equalization/convoandmedianfilter.m) convoandmedianfilter.m  
    Convolutional filters seem to not be as good as median filters in noise cleanup.
* [Resolution](../3.%20Smoothening%20and%20Histogram%20Equalization/difference.m) difference.m  
    Subtracting the background of an image to obtain the region of interest.
