### Smoothening and Histogram Manipulation
We play with contrast stretching and median filter in this lab.

1. [Contrast Stretching and Histogram Equalization](../3.%20Smoothening%20and%20Histogram%20Manipulation/contraststretchhistoequal.m) contraststretchhistoequal.m  
    Contrast stretching vs. histogram equalization.
2. [Quantization](../3.%20Smoothening%20and%20Histogram%20Manipulation/convoandmedianfilter.m) convoandmedianfilter.m  
    Convolutional filters seem to not be as good as median filters in noise cleanup.
3. [Resolution](../3.%20Smoothening%20and%20Histogram%20Manipulation/difference.m) difference.m  
    Subtracting the background of an image to obtain the region of interest.
