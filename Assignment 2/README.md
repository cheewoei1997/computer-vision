# Assignment 2
### Challenge 1
In this challenge, you are going to develop an automated equation solver. Given a line of equation, your program should be able to recognize each of the numbers and symbols in the image and output the result of the operation. For example, given the sample equation in Figure 1, your program need to output the result as “13”.

During your presentation, you will be given a random set of numbers and mathematic operations (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Your program should be able to yield the correct answer for the equation given to you. The equation given to you in Figure 1 is only a sample. You need to make sure your program can work with any combination of numbers and mathematical operations.

### Challenge 2
In this assignment, you are going to create a robot which simulate human’s behavior to sense and detect people around you. Your robot should take in a short video and count the number of people in the video. The current number of people appearing in the video should be displayed on the screen. A sample of your program output looks as follows:

**What you should do?**
1. Record a video of you and your friends walking across a scene.
2. You can use a clean background (e.g. white background) to ease your segmentation process.
3. Input the video to your program.
4. Your program should be able to detect and count the number of people in the video, e.g. when there is no people in the scene, no warning message will appear; when there is one or more people entering the scene, the message will tell there is a people approaching you, and tell the number of people.
5. Extra mark will be given for any effort you put beyond the basic requirements, e.g. you input a real-time video instead of a pre-recorded one, you use a complicated background, etc..
6. You can refer to the video clip called terminator which I uploaded in MMLS to get some inspiration for your project.
